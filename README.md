## Your First AI Agent using Function Calling

This guide provides a beginner-friendly tutorial on creating your first AI-powered file management agent using function calling techniques. The agent intelligently interprets user commands to automate essential file operations — such as listing, reading, and renaming files — within a test directory containing sample files. By combining a Large Language Model (LLM) with local function calls, the agent delivers efficient task execution, enhanced by state management through a file content cache for optimal performance. The tutorial walks through project setup using uv Python package manager, designing modular functions, building the AI agent, and testing its functionality, with an emphasis on security, error handling, and extensibility. Ideal for those new to AI-driven automation, this project lays a solid foundation for develop
